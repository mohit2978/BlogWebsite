    <h1>Five Tips for FrontEnd Developers</h1>
    <p>Don’t &nbsp; you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites
         with a clean user interface? While most of us would reply with an 
         assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill 
         that goes into making a website attractive and user-friendly. The 
         secret to creating an impressive site is to 
        master the art of front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!</p>
    <p>However, it is not impossible either. 
        Here are five tips that’ll help you get
         better in front-end design and web development</p>
<ol>
     <li>
        Commenting
        <p>
            Commenting is one such practice that is often
             ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written
              by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important 
              part of project you create. With proper comments and organised files 
              its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where 
              things are at and how they work.

             development tools, from browser add-ons to smart plugins,
              the amount of choices available now is massive! So,
               why not invest in some really productive web tools that’

        Always Be Curious
        <p>
            A front-end developer has to keep
             himself/herself updated continuously with the latest 
             news and innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive 
             stand and learn new things about front-end development from informative
              blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful
               learning sources for front-end developers -

        <p>
            Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. 
            These meet-ups provide excellent opportunities to expand your
             network and get acquainted with talented people.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Refactor Your Code From Time To Time
        <p>
            By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the 
            code without tampering with its functionality. This will improve
             the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often
              you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and 
              fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most 
              significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code 
              remains free from plagiarism.

    <li>
        Automate!
        <p>
            As a front-end developer, you already have to 
            take care of minute little details that can get 
            overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time
             on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency
              management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, 
              and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?
